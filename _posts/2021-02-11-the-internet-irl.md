The year is 1988, and you are suddenly dropped into a strange new world. You
recognize parts of it, but it feels foreign - cold, accelerated, maybe creepy.

What you do not know is that you have been dropped into **The Internet IRL**,
and the year is 2021.

**Facebook Wedding** -- It's your big day! You're getting married. Friends,
family, people you met once at a coffee shop, your crazed alt-right uncle, the
girl you went on one date with - they're all enjoying cocktails. Many are
arguing, most are watching them on the sideline with a confused stare.

**Instagram House Party** -- There's a huge house party tonight. George Michael
is making a guest appearance, Guns 'n Roses will be raging, and hell, Rick
Astley might even show up. Unfortunately, you weren't invited and will probably
stay home tonight. Luckily for you, everyone is going to mail you a postcard,
and pictures documenting everything you missed out on. So, in a weird way, it
was almost like you were there, right?

Personally, I'm not a big fan of **The Internet IRL**. It trades _authenticity_
for _shock value_, and _relationships_ for _interactions_. And unfortunately,
there's not real opt-out button for this reality for lovers of the internet.

In my opinion, the ability to freely share a blog post on the internet is the
greatest achievement of the internet. And given that I want a place online
where I could be more authentic, and meet some like-minded folks...

Restarting my blahg.
