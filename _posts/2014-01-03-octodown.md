Ever wanted to easily preview what you markdown would look like *exactly* on
Github? Ever wanted to do that from inside of a Terminal? Well this Gem is for
you. Dead simple. Never get caught writing ugly markdown again.

![Octodown]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianks/octodown/master/assets/octodown.gif)

## Features:

  * Uses the same markdown parsers and CSS as Github for true duplication.
    - Yes emojis *are* included.
  * Fast. `octodown` uses native parsers to ensure performance.
  * Multiple CSS styles. Choose from either.
    - `$ octodown --style atom README.md`
    - The `github.com` markdown (default)
    - The `Atom` text editor markdown
  * Properly parses `STDIN`.
    - `$ cat README.md | octodown`

## Installation

  1. Install `icu4c` and `cmake`:
    * Mac: `$ brew install icu4c cmake`
    * Apt: `$ sudo apt-get install -y libicu-dev cmake`
  2. If you have a non-system Ruby (*highly recommended*):
    * `$ gem install octodown`
  3. Else:
    * `$ sudo gem install octodown`

## Usage

  1. Basic:
    * `$ octodown README.md`
  2. Markdown preview styling:
    * `$ octodown --style atom README.md`
  3. *nix lovers:
    * `$ echo '# Hello world!' | octodown --raw > index.html`

## Notes

  1. With no arguments given, octodown will read `STDIN` until `EOF` is reached.
    * In order to work with this mode, type what you want into the input, then press
  `Ctrl-D` when finished.
  2. `octodown` attempts to use default OS support for opening HTML files from
  terminal. In Mac, this would be the `open` command; for Linux it is either
  `xdg-open` or `x-www-browser`. If these are not set, octodown will not
  automatically open the file in the browser. If octodown doesn't have the
  commands neccesary to open files in a browser, please consider opening a pull
  request to add support!
