First and foremost, I am an equal opportunity creator. There is nothing I enjoy
more than watching something come from nothing. If it involves the act of
making, I've probably given it a serious shot: coding, soldering, creating
music, etc. This is a recurring, pervasive theme in my life. Eventually I
decided to embrace the mad scientist within. Happy ever after.

I'm a social person. I'm fascinated by people's stories, and learning from
other's perspectives. From my experience, my greatest triumphs have come from
when I have successfully worked _collaboratively_ with others on projects. This
is not to undermine the importance of solitude in solving problems; there is a
complementary relationship between the two. "Everything in moderation," or so
they say.

In my personal life,  I love traveling around playing [my music][1] for people.
Either the dream of being a rockstar never seemed to fade, or blasting loud
music never seems to get old; I can't tell. I'm a sucker for philosophical
discussions erring on the side of the deontological. Luckily for you, I won't
make it my mission to bore you with my opinions _too_ often. Some have
described me as highly empathetic. It's a nice counter to my technical,
assertive side. Like most empaths, I do love dogs.

# Open source contributions

## [Octodown][2]

- Local Github markdown server. I wanted to preview my Github markdown in
real time, so I built this.

## [Viz: Vizualize data streams in the browser][3]

- This tool uses D3, React.js, and a few other tools to allow users to create
interactive visualization in the browser. In a sense it is similar to
Tableau; however, Tableau only works well for static charts. Humans learn
from interaction, so our goal is to bring interaction to data.

## [Tuxedio][4]

- An online experience marketplace built with Rails and Angular.

## [Domout][5]

- Pipe data to your browser from Node

## [Atlas Traffic Monitor][6]

- A group of friends and I built a multi-media interactive installation using
3 Arduinos, one Raspberry Pi, and many lines of Javascript and Python. This
was part of a live data-art display where we sought to show how users could
interact with software and data for creative pursuits.

## [Ruby on Rails][7]

- Patch to Rails which mitigates possible DoS attacks
- http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/118954
- Various other fixes

## [linux-sched-benchmark][8]

- A tool for benchmarking Linux schedulers under different workloads. It uses
`getrusage()` under the hood to give real resource statistics about the
program under different schedulers.

## [gethostbyname-ruby][9]

- A ruby wrapper around the C gethostbyname function

## [yadr-alt: Tidiest dotfile setup around][10]

- https://github.com/ianks/yadr-alt

# Talks

- I'm fascinated by Bitcoin, and have [given
talks](/assets/docs/BitcoinPresentation.pdf) about the creative uses of
blockchain technology.
