First and foremost, I am an equal-oppurtunity creator. There is nothing I enjoy
more than watching *something* be born from *nothing*. If it involves the act of
making, I've probably dabbled in it.

I am passionate about [collaboratively building
software](https://github.com/ianks).

I do hackathons. I have helped [host
one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkK0PabP2to), and I have [won
two](http://ianks.com/year-of-hackathons/).

I love traveling around playing [my music](https://soundcloud.com/ionik) to
people as an electronic musician.

A group of friends and I built multi-media interactive installation using
3 Arduinos, one Raspberry Pi, and many lines of Javascript and Python.

I am currently in the early stages of building the API for an [online experience
marketplace](https://github.com/tuxedio).

I'm fascinated by Bitcoin, and have [given
talks]({{"/assets/BitcoinPresentation.pdf" | prepend:site.baseurl}})
about to creative uses of blockchain technology.

I'm an avid VIM user. Check out my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/ianks/yadr-alt).

Most of all, I'm a social person. I'm fascinated by people's stories, and
learning from other's perspectives.
